# ANN_Steps

**1. Project Setup and Data Preparation**

* **1.1. Environment Setup:**
    * Specify the programming language (e.g., Python) and required libraries (e.g., TensorFlow, Keras, PyTorch, scikit-learn).
    * Provide instructions on how to set up the environment (e.g., using `conda`, `venv`, or Docker).
    * Example in README:
        ```markdown
        ## Environment Setup

        1.  Create a virtual environment (recommended):
            ```bash
            python -m venv venv
            source venv/bin/activate  # On Linux/macOS
            venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
            ```
        2.  Install required packages:
            ```bash
            pip install tensorflow scikit-learn pandas numpy matplotlib
            ```
        ```
* **1.2. Data Acquisition:**
    * Describe the source of the dataset (e.g., Kaggle, UCI Machine Learning Repository, custom data).
    * If the dataset is included in the repository, mention its location.
    * If it's downloaded, provide instructions or a script for downloading it.
* **1.3. Data Preprocessing:**
    * Explain the steps taken to clean and prepare the data:
        * Handling missing values (imputation, removal).
        * Encoding categorical variables (one-hot encoding, label encoding).
        * Scaling or normalizing numerical features (standardization, min-max scaling).
        * Splitting the data into training, validation, and test sets.
    * Example :
        ```markdown
        ### Data Preprocessing

        1.  Loaded the dataset using Pandas.
        2.  Handled missing values by imputing with the mean.
        3.  Scaled numerical features using StandardScaler.
        4.  Encoded categorical features using OneHotEncoder.
        5.  Split the data into training (70%), validation (15%), and test (15%) sets.
        ```

**2. Model Architecture and Implementation**

* **2.1. Model Architecture:**
    * Describe the architecture of the ANN:
        * Number of layers (input, hidden, output).
        * Number of neurons in each layer.
        * Activation functions used (ReLU, sigmoid, tanh, etc.).
        * Type of network (feedforward, recurrent, convolutional, etc.).
        * Any regularization techniques used (dropout, L1/L2 regularization).
    * Create a visual representation of the model if possible.
    * Example :
        ```markdown
        ### Model Architecture

        The model is a feedforward neural network with:

        * Input layer: [Number] neurons
        * Hidden layer 1: [Number] neurons, ReLU activation
        * Hidden layer 2: [Number] neurons, ReLU activation
        * Output layer: [Number] neurons, Sigmoid activation (for binary classification)

        Dropout regularization (rate=0.2) is applied after each hidden layer.
        ```
* **2.2. Model Implementation:**
    * Provide the code for creating the ANN model using your chosen library (TensorFlow/Keras, PyTorch).
    * Explain the choice of loss function (e.g., binary cross-entropy, categorical cross-entropy, mean squared error).
    * Explain the choice of optimizer (e.g., Adam, SGD, RMSprop).
    * Example :
        ```python
        # Example using TensorFlow/Keras
        model = tf.keras.models.Sequential([
            tf.keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='relu', input_shape=(input_shape,)),
            tf.keras.layers.Dropout(0.2),
            tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu'),
            tf.keras.layers.Dropout(0.2),
            tf.keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid') # Binary classification
        ])

        model.compile(optimizer='adam',
                      loss='binary_crossentropy',
                      metrics=['accuracy'])
        ```

**3. Model Training and Evaluation**

* **3.1. Model Training:**
    * Describe the training process:
        * Number of epochs.
        * Batch size.
        * Use of validation data.
        * Include code snippets that show how the model is trained.
    * Example :
        ```python
        history = model.fit(X_train, y_train,
                            epochs=50,
                            batch_size=32,
                            validation_data=(X_val, y_val))
        ```
* **3.2. Model Evaluation:**
    * Explain how the model's performance was evaluated:
        * Metrics used (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, AUC, etc.).
        * Results on the test set.
        * Visualizations of training history (loss curves, accuracy curves).
        * Example :
            ```markdown
            ### Model Evaluation

            The model achieved an accuracy of [Value]% on the test set.

            [Include plots of training/validation loss and accuracy]

        ```

        loaded_model = tf.keras.models.load_model('my_model.h5')
